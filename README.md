# Vaccine-Research-Project
We are looking at historical Covid-19 data to track the total usage of vaccinations around the world as well as their efficiency. The goal of this reserach project is to highlight the progress of COVID-19 as well as their respective vaccines in order to tell what worked and what didn't. Where did nations go wrong and where did nations act correctly? How can we verify the progression and mitigation of this pandemic to fully understand its impact.

* When did we see spikes in vaccines usage and what happened contextually
* What were common causes of COVID-19 case spreads?
* What traits of countires were most correlated with the spread and mitigation of Covid-19?
* Best and worst handlers of the vaccine?

## Methods
