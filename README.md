# Drug Performance Research Project
## Abstract
This research project aims to investigate the effects of various drugs and performance-enhancing substances on human physiology and performance outcomes. By examining both clinical trial data and real-world usage reports, the goal is to determine which substances provide the most significant performance benefits, identify their potential side effects, and clarify the tradeoffs involved in their use.

## Objectives 
- Identify commonly used performance-enhancing substances and drugs.
- Compare efficacy, measured improvements, and performance metrics across these substances.
- Evaluate potential side effects, health risks, and long-term outcomes.
- Determine a risk-benefit profile for each substance to help guide informed decision-making.

### Major Column Descriptors:

#### generic_name:
The chemical name of the drug (not brand name)
#### drug_classes:
The drug belongs to which drug class, i.e a drug class is a set of medications and other compounds that have a similar chemical structure, the same mechanism of action (i.e. binding to the same biological target), a related mode of action, and/or are used to treat the same disease.
brand_names:
brand names in which the drugs are being sold or available in the market.
#### activity:
Activity is based on recent site visitor activity relative to other medications in the list. Data was gathered from https://www.drugs.com
#### rx_otc:
Rx-to-OTC switch is the transfer of proven prescription drugs to nonprescription, where
OTC (Over-the-counter) = Medication that can be purchased without a medical prescription
Rx = Prescription Needed
Rx/OTC = Prescription or Over-the-counter.

#### pregnancy_category:
A = Adequate and well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters).
B = Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
C = Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use in pregnant women despite potential risks.
D = There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use in pregnant women despite potential risks.
X = Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risks involved in use in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.
N = FDA has not classified the drug.

#### csa:

Controlled Substances Act (CSA) Schedule
M = The drug has multiple schedules. The schedule may depend on the exact dosage form or strength of the medication.
U = CSA Schedule is unknown.
N = Is not subject to the Controlled Substances Act.
1 = Has a high potential for abuse. Has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. There is a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.
2 = Has a high potential for abuse. Has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions. Abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
3 = Has a potential for abuse less than those in schedules 1 and 2. Has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.
4 = Has a low potential for abuse relative to those in schedule 3. It has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to those in schedule 3.
5 = Has a low potential for abuse relative to those in schedule 4. Has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to those in schedule 4.

#### alcohol:
X = Interacts with Alcohol.

#### rating:
For ratings, users were asked how effective they found the medicine while considering positive/adverse effects and ease of use (1 = not effective, 10 = most effective).
